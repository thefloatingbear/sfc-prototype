        User feedback
      </h2>

      <p>
       All participants preferred this route as it specified that they could proceed with creating worker records for their establishment.
       <p>

      <p>
      They liked the freedom and flexibility to continue if they wanted to which would be better to them from a time management perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
       All understood their records would be saved in draft format, but losing their data was a big risk if they were denied approval from SfC. Some users would input their data as they described themselves as "bona fide", whereas others saw the risk of wasting time and losing data - so would postpone until approval.
      </p>

      <p>
      Users hope that SfC would contact them if there were discrepencies in their establishment data and attempt to resolve the issue with them before denying approval and discarding their data immediately.
